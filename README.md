# SAR-based-tank-detection
Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective remote sensor for target detection and 
recognition. Deep learning has great potential for implementing automatic target 
recognition based on SAR images. We use the SSD MobileNetV2 FPN-Lite 320x320 pretrained model and YOLOv8 nano model and then compare their results. The experiments 
are performed on MSTAR (Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition) 
Military Tank dataset. Here we used Google Colab as a platform to execute the proposed 
application on some sample SAR images and find out the efficiency of our proposed 
application. The results obtained from the sample SAR images demonstrate the potential 
SSD MobileNetV2 FPN-Lite 320x320 of deep learning model in SAR-based target 
detection and recognition
